真實摘要: It's a race for the governor's mansion in 11 states today, and the GOP could end the night at the helm of more than two-thirds of the 50 states. The GOP currently controls 29 of the country's top state offices; it's expected to keep the three Republican ones that are up for grabs (Utah, North Dakota, and Indiana), and wrest North Carolina from the Dems. That brings its toll to 30, with the potential to take three more, reports NPR. Races in Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington are still too close to call, and in all three, Democrat incumbents aren't seeking reelection. The results could have a big impact on health care, since a Supreme Court ruling grants states the ability to opt out of ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion. "A Romney victory would dramatically empower Republican governors," said one analyst. Click for NPR's state-by-state breakdown of what could happen.
模型生成摘要: Voters in 11 states will pick their governors tonight, and Republicans appear on track to increase their numbers by at least one, with the potential to extend their hold to more than two-thirds of the nation's top state offices, NPR reports. Eight of the gubernatorial seats up for grabs are now held by Democrats; three are in Republican hands. Republicans currently hold 29 governorships, Democrats have 20, and Rhode Island's Gov. Lincoln Chafee is an Independent. Polls and race analysts suggest that only three of tonight's contests are considered competitive, all in states where incumbent Democratic governors aren't running again: Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington. While those state races remain too close to call, Republicans are expected to wrest the North Carolina governorship from Democratic control, and to easily win GOP-held seats in Utah, North Dakota, and Indiana. Democrats are likely to hold on to their seats in West Virginia and Missouri, and are expected to notch safe wins in races for seats they hold in Vermont and Delaware.

真實摘要: It turns out Facebook is only guilty of about half of what it’s been accused of in the gay kiss incident. The social networking site apologized yesterday for taking down an image used to promote a “kiss-in” event in London. “The photo in question does not violate our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, and was removed in error,” the site said in a statement, according to the Advocate. But Facebook did not, as has been reported in several places, take down the kiss-in event itself. Here’s what happened: The photo Facebook took down was posted by the Dangerous Minds blog to promote the event. In its initial write-up about the incident, the blog observed that the page organizing the protest had been taken down. But it was actually the organizer himself who "removed" the event, Dangerous Minds clarified. Organizer Paul Shetler explains that he decided to switch it from a public event to a private one, as "there were starting to be trolls posting abusive nonsense on it."
模型生成摘要: John Snow’s kiss with a friend on Facebook has sparked a debate about gay rights—but it’s not the first time the two men have shared a kiss. In fact, it’s the first time they’ve even kissed in public, reports the Telegraph. Snow, who is gay, posted a photo of himself and a friend kissing on Facebook last week, and it quickly went viral. It even got picked up by the BBC, which aired a clip of the kiss in its entirety. “I think it’s great that people are talking about it,” said Snow. “It’s great that people are talking about it. It’s great that people are talking about it. It’s great that people are talking about it.”

真實摘要: Not a big fan of Southern California? Neither is Northern California, apparently. Supervisors in rural Siskiyou County voted 4-1 Tuesday in favor of seceding from the state, reports the Times-Standard. The county thinks state officials in Sacramento are too focused on the big metro areas of the south and thus want to form a state of its own—to be called Jefferson. Supporters want to invite other northern counties, and perhaps a few from Oregon, to join, too, notes the Los Angeles Times. ”We have to have government that's local, understands our issues, and has empathy,” says one local rancher. It's clearly a very long-shot bid, one that would eventually require the blessing of both the state legislature and the US Congress. Still, neighboring Humboldt County is expected to meet soon to consider the idea. (Meanwhile, some counties in Colorado want to form a new state of their own.)
模型生成摘要: Residents of a Northern California county want to secede from California and form a new state called Jefferson. The Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors voted 4-1 yesterday to pursue seceding from the state, reports the Redding Record Searchlight. "Many proposed laws are unconstitutional and deny us our God-given rights," said one resident. "We need our own state so we can make laws that fit our way of life." The Los Angeles Times reports that more than 100 people filled the supervisors' chambers, and when a speaker asked who was in favor of seceding, "nearly every hand in the room was raised." Proponents say Siskiyou should form a new state with other counties in Northern California and Southern Oregon that share similar interests. Resident complaints include a lack of representation in Sacramento and insufficient attention to major issues for the county, such as water rights and a rural fire prevention fee. "We have to have government that's local, understands our issues, and has empathy," said rancher Mark Baird, who is leading the effort.

真實摘要: Why did Microsoft buy Nokia's phone business? We now know Microsoft's answer: The computing giant released a 30-slide presentation today arguing that the move will improve Microsoft's margins on Windows phones, which will allow it to invest more in the platform, which will accelerate sales and market share growth, the Washington Post reports. But John Herrman at Buzzfeed has another explanation: "Fear of dying alone." Here's what he and other pundits are saying: The presentation "manages to sound both insane and uninspiring, outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic," Herman argues—like capturing a whole 15% of the smartphone market. "It's a fitting end for the close of Microsoft's Ballmer era, during which the company … missed out on the most important change in consumer electronics in decades" while remaining profitable in unglamorous ways. Like everyone, Microsoft is trying to ape the Apple model, MobileOpportunity observes. But it's not so sure that's a good idea. "There already is an apple," the blog points out, and other software/hardware hybrid companies, like Palm and BlackBerry, have been crushed under its heel. Maybe Microsoft should have tried to patch up its tried-and-true strategy of licensing its OS. The move risks complicating Microsoft's crucial relationships with other PC and device manufacturers, one analyst tells ZDNet. But he adds that "Microsoft needed to make a bold move" or face "certain terminal decline," and that the price it paid for Nokia "seems extremely reasonable." Meanwhile, Matthew Yglesias at Slate digs up a fairly interesting memo from Nokia CEO (and, perhaps, Microsoft heir apparent) Stephen Elop, in which he uses the story of a Deepwater Horizon worker leaping from the burning oil platform—a seemingly desperate, yet necessary move—to explain the company's shift from its own failed OS to Windows Phone. Of course, Yglesias notes, that move "was basically a total failure." To read the full parable, click here.
模型生成摘要: Microsoft's purchase of Nokia is the latest move in the company's evolution from a "moribund world of the beige desktop" to a "sunlit world of smartphones and tablets," notes ZDNet. But analysts aren't exactly sure what that means for the company. Here's what they're saying: The deal is a "spectacular" one, writes Dan Nosowitz at the Los Angeles Times. Nokia "did not have a truly compelling smartphone ready when a large segment of the developed world was first compelled by smartphones," he writes. "Whether this was the result of complacency—Nokia was, in the mid-2000s, the leader of the niche smartphone category—doesn't matter now." The deal is a "deeply strange and somewhat sad" one, writes Adam Clark Estes at Business Insider. "Microsoft needed to make a bold move into mobile," he writes. "Not doing so would mean certain terminal decline. This way at least holds out some chance of survival." The acquisition is a step in that direction, but Microsoft needs to find a way to unite the various brands—Nokia, Windows, Live, Surface, Xbox, Bing—into a coherent experience that will win customer loyalty. "That's a tall order and one that should weigh strongly on the board's choice of a new CEO," says one analyst. "The timing of the announcement seems mighty strange," adds the Verge. "For such a big deal to come just days after Ballmer stood down seems mighty strange."

真實摘要: The Supreme Court is facing a docket of high-profile political cases that will test whether recent liberal victories were more fluke or firm conviction, the New York Times reports. The court—which is divided 5-4 for conservatives, but saw Justice Roberts vote liberal on Obamacare and same-sex marriage—will look at cases including unions, affirmative action, and possibly abortion. A primer: Unions: Since 1977, unions have been allowed to charge non-union workers for dues that go to collective bargaining efforts, but not political ones. Now California teachers have brought a case saying collective bargaining is itself political. "It could set the stage for a Citizens United-style reconsideration in the area of union dues," a lawyer says. Affirmative Action: Abigail Fisher says that being white played a role in the University of Texas denying her admission back in 2008. The Supreme Court punted on her case in 2013, and now it's back on the docket. Like the unions case, this was brought by a conservative group that recruited the plaintiffs. The death penalty: Justices will decide on capital-punishment cases in Pennsylvania, Kansas, Georgia, and Florida, the Wall Street Journal reports. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer have already expressed doubts about whether capital punishment is constitutional. "One person, one vote": Should state legislative districts be drawn based on their number of people or eligible voters? If justices choose the latter—leaving out immigrants and children—Latinos could lose political clout and rural areas will gain, Politico reports. Abortion: Justices may opt to revisit a Texas law that could reduce the state's abortion clinics from more than 40 to roughly 10. At issue is whether new clinic requirements are an "undue burden" on women's right to an abortion. One commentator believes this Supreme Court session will be ugly for liberals.
模型生成摘要: The Supreme Court kicks off its new term today, and it's safe to say that by the time it wraps up, the issue of abortion will have been decided. The court has not heard an abortion case since 1992, when it reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion identified in Roe v. Wade, the New York Times reports. This term, the court is expected to hear a challenge to a Texas law that would cut the number of abortion clinics in the state from more than 40 to 10, the Times reports. The case, brought by the Little Sisters of the Poor, is expected to be the most important since the court reaffirmed the right to abortion in 1973. Other key cases on the court's docket this term include a case on affirmative action at state universities and a case on state efforts to limit abortion by regulating clinics and doctors, Politico reports. The court is also expected to hear challenges to requirements that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and that abortion clinics meet standards for hospitals or surgical centers. The justices haven't signaled which of the challenges, if any, they'll consider, but they're expected to do so in the coming weeks.

真實摘要: In 1783, after the British soldiers left New York City, George Washington is believed to have stopped for a celebratory drink at the Bull's Head tavern. Now a preservationist thinks he's found the historic site—and if he's right, it could be the oldest building in Manhattan. Adam Woodward had heard that the building at 50 Bowery, currently scheduled to be demolished so a hotel can go up, might have "the Bull's Head's structure, cellar, bones," he tells CBS New York. So he searched the basement, and "found myself in what I am pretty certain is the 1750s historic tavern," he says. Specifically, he found what he thinks are hand-hewn and hand-planed joists and foundation walls from the Colonial era. Since that time, the building has housed a drugstore, a Chinese restaurant, and a beer garden, among other things. Now he's hoping city officials will preserve the site, saying, "What an incredible opportunity that the city suddenly has for this thing to re-emerge." A historian is also convinced it is indeed the old tavern, and investigations have been launched by elected officials and the Landmarks Preservation Commission, Eater NY reports. But ultimately, the commission says, it "cannot require the owner to conduct archaeology," so a lot depends on him. He's apparently not talking yet; the New York Times couldn't get hold of him.
模型生成摘要: A preservationist says he's found evidence that a Manhattan building once housed the Bull's Head Tavern, where George Washington is believed to have had a celebratory drink during the American Revolution. The building at 50 Bowery is being prepared for demolition so a hotel can be built at the site. Legend has it that "the Bull's Head's structure, cellar, bones" were still inside, CBS New York reports. So preservationist Adam Woodward decided to investigate, and found what he believes are Colonial-era, hand-hewn and hand-planed joists and foundation walls. "Found myself in what I am pretty certain is the 1750s historic tavern," he says. Woodward says he felt compelled to investigate in the building, which once housed a chain drugstore and the Atlantic Garden beer garden, because time was running out. "I just realized that it would be the last chance to solve one of the great mysteries of New York City history," he says. "It was pretty incredible walking back in time 250 years." Historian and author David Freeland says the find "would make it very likely the oldest building remaining in Manhattan." The Bull's Head opened around 1750 on the fringe of what was a still-young city concentrated below the Bowery. Washington and his troops marched down the Bowery and stopped there in 1783 before making "their official entrance into the city proper," historian Kerri Culhane says. The neighborhood "was a butchers’ district in the 18th century and the 19th century," she adds. "People drove livestock down from the hinterland and the slaughterhouse was behind the Bowery. That’s where the trading took place." It was also a home to the ancestors of future PI's. "I can’t think of another lot in Manhattan that has a more important history, and the fact that it might be intact, a couple of feet under the building, is an incredible opportunity to get on archaeological record," Woodward tells the New York Times.

真實摘要: Israel launched a round of airstrikes on Gaza today, wounding two militants and eight bystanders, including some children. Israel says the attack was retaliation for a round of Palestinian rockets fired yesterday, which Palestinians say were in response to another Israeli airstrike earlier in the day, Reuters reports. More than 470 rockets have been fired from Gaza since June, but this was the first time Hamas acknowledged responsibility. As usual the rockets failed to harm anyone, though one did kill some goats at a petting zoo. The incident comes in the wake of a drone flight into Israeli airspace this weekend, which some have speculated came from Iran. An Iranian military official today boasted that the incident proved that Israel is vulnerable, and that its anti-missile defense system "does not work and lacks the necessary capacity." But he denied that the drone was made by Iran, saying such accusations represented a "psychological operation" on Israel's part. "The Zionist regime has many enemies," he said. Iran, meanwhile, is blaming Israel for a hack attack on its oil rigs.
模型生成摘要: Israel's air force shot down a drone over the West Bank on Saturday, but it's not clear where the aircraft came from, Reuters reports. Israeli parliament member Miri Regev tweeted that it was an "Iranian drone launched by Hezbollah." An Iranian military official says the incident shows that Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile defense system "does not work and lacks the necessary capacity." Iron Dome is designed to shoot down short-range guerrilla rockets, not slow-flying aircraft. It intercepted more than 80% of the targets it engaged in March when nearly 300 rockets and mortars were fired at southern Israel, the Pentagon said at the time. The drone was first spotted above the Mediterranean near the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip to the west of Israel. An Israeli warplane shot it down above a forest near the occupied West Bank. Aberoumand attributed claims the drone was made by Iran to a "psychological operation" by Israel, but did not confirm or deny them. "The Zionist regime (Israel) has many enemies," he added.

真實摘要: A Picasso painting that was found to have vanished from a Paris museum more than a decade ago has turned up—in the US, in a package shipped from Belgium. Its papers identified it as a $37 "art craft/toy" and also included the line "Joyeux Noel," or Merry Christmas, the New York Times reports. A man named "Robert" attempted to send the package to a climate-controlled warehouse in Queens, New York, in December, but custom officials at the Port of Newark seized what turned out to be Picasso's 1911 La Coiffeuse (The Hairdresser). French museum officials traveled to New York last month and confirmed the find is indeed the missing Picasso work, which the Centre Georges Pompidou realized was missing from its storerooms in 2001 following a loan request; it was then valued at more than $2.5 million. Court documents don't specify whether the sender or would-be recipient have been identified, NBC News reports, but "a lost treasure has been found," US attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement. She filed a civil complaint yesterday that will have the painting returned to France. The Pompidou's director, who called the painting's rediscovery a "true comfort," hopes the painting can go on display at the museum as early as May, the AP reports. (Another Picasso work was stolen days before this one was found.)
模型生成摘要: A stolen Picasso worth millions of dollars was shipped to the US in a package that described it as a $37 "art craft," but it will soon be on its way back to France, NBC News reports. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn filed papers Thursday to forfeit the century-old cubist painting, which was swiped from a museum storeroom in 2001. "A lost treasure has been found," US Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement. The canvas, titled "La Coiffeuse," was bequeathed to France's National Museum and was placed in storage at the Centre Georges Pompidou, where staffers discovered it was missing when they received a loan request for it. It was shipped by Federal Express from Belgium in December and seized at the Port of Newark. Officials said the shipper was identified only as "Robert" and the destination was a climate-controlled storage facility in Queens. Court papers did not indicate whether the sender or intended recipient have been identified. Pompidou director Alain Seban said the discovery comes as a "true comfort" at a time when the cultural world is reeling from an Islamic State video showing the destruction of statues in Iraq, the AP reports. Seban said in a statement Friday that he hopes the work can be exhibited again publicly in May. US and French authorities have not announced any arrests in the case.

真實摘要: A dispute over the freshness of Wendy’s fries leaves a 25-year-old Minnesota woman facing criminal charges. According to CBS Minnesota, Wendy's employees claim that Eiram Chanel Amir Dixson became argumentative during a drive-thru transaction just after noon Thursday after the woman asked specifically for fresh French fries. Reports don't specify the condition of the fries, or whether she even received them, but do make clear that an argument followed. Employees allege Dixson reached through the drive-thru window and, after an employee threw a soft drink at her, proceeded to spray them with Mace. The restaurant manager was hit directly in the face while two more employees were also in the line of the spray, per the police report. All three employees provided similar accounts of the incident, according to ABC News 5. Dixson is being charged with felony use of tear gas to immobilize. If found guilty, she’ll face a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison and/or a $3,000 to $10,000 fine. Wendy’s drive-thrus see their share of action: last year, a worker was allegedly bit over a wrong order in Virginia, while a Florida man reportedly threw an alligator through a drive-thru window as a prank.

真實摘要: A 27-year-old Dallas police officer died Wednesday after being shot the day prior at a Home Depot in Lake Highlands. The Morning News identifies the officer as Rogelio Santander. He'd been called to the store around 4pm by a cop who was working an off-duty job there and noticed Armando Luis Juarez was behaving oddly. The off-duty cop detained Juarez and learned he had an outstanding felony warrant. Santander and Crystal Almeida, 26, responded to the scene; authorities say they and a loss prevention officer employed by Home Depot were shot by Juarez as he was being escorted from the store. A source tells CBS Dallas Santander was shot in the back of the head and Almeida was shot in the face. She remains in critical condition, as does the Home Depot employee. Police say Juarez fled and a high-speed car chase ensued, per the AP. He was apprehended Tuesday night and is being held on charges of aggravated assault on a public servant and felony theft. "We got our man," said Mayor Mike Rawlings.

真實摘要: The US Coast Guard says it's looking for a man who has cost the service about $500,000 after responding to nearly 30 of his fake distress calls, reports the AP. In a press release published Friday, the Coast Guard says the 28 calls have originated from around the area of Annapolis, Maryland. Each call involved the same male voice and used an emergency radio channel. He's been making the calls since July 2014. The two most recent calls were made on the night of July 21 and the early morning of July 22. “A hoax call is a deadly and serious offense,” a Coast Guard rep tells NBC4, which notes that such calls are a felony that carry six years in prison, $10,000 civil fine, $250,000 criminal fine, and reimbursement to the Coast Guard. "Calls like these not only put our crews at risk, but they put the lives of the public at risk.”
